It pursued them as far as Point Pleasant city limits.[9]\nDuring the next few days, other people reported similar sightings, after local newspapers reported it. Two volunteer firemen who saw it said it was a \"large bird with red eyes\". Mason County Sheriff George Johnson commented that he believed the sightings were due to an unusually large heron he termed a \"shitepoke\". Contractor Newell Partridge told Johnson that when he aimed a flashlight at a creature in a nearby field, its eyes glowed \"like bicycle reflectors\". Additionally, he blamed buzzing noises from his television set and the disappearance of his German Shepherd dog on the creature.[2] Wildlife biologist Robert L. Smith at West Virginia University told reporters that descriptions and sightings all fit the sandhill crane, a large American crane almost as tall as a man with a seven-foot wingspan featuring circles of reddish coloring around the eyes. The bird may have wandered out of its migration route, and therefore was unrecognized at first because it was not native to this region.[2][3]"
